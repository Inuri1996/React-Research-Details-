                    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>All final year students in the Faculty of Technology (FT) are required to undertake a 
Final Research and Development Project (FRDP) module, which will be considered a 
project and/or research. This module is compulsory in all degree programs offered in 
FT. It requires students to do a research project / innovative project/business project 
/system development project/product development/design and/ or development work in 
each discipline, especially on real-world problems, which would motivate them to 
produce practical solutions. It is an opportunity for students to use problem-solving tools 
and techniques to solve the problems they encounter. With this approach, the learning 
process is gained through the 'by-doing' (practical) experience. Management concepts 
which provide students with skills required for managing a project are also incorporated. 
Thus, the students are expected to be well rounded by mastering various useful 
disciplines, which will enable them to participate and prepare for future employment.<br/><br/>
Working under the guidance of a supervisor(s), students may shape the direction of what 
they want to be and gain a better understanding of the responsibilities they have to carry 
out when they undertake a project. Teamwork will be inculcated with the development 
of excellent and professional relationships with their supervisor(s) and colleagues. The 
undertaken project can also be used as a basis for employment by fully exploiting the 
learning process they have gone through, the skills they have gathered and the 
experience they have gained from the project.
These guidelines are prepared for students and supervisors to effectively execute their 
respective roles and responsibilities, hence benefiting both parties.</p>
